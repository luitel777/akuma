# Akuma
Selfhosted manga server written in go.

An archive format should be
```
archive_name/
    volume_00.cbz
    volume_01.cbz
    ...
    volume_10.cbz
```

```sh
$ ./x
$ ./akuma
```
akuma is a standalone binary but it needs to be in a folder where there is manga folder.

# Plans
- add toml config system
- make ui pleasant to look
